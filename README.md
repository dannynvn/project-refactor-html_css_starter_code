This project is Challenge 1 of a boot camp. The challenge type is an on-the-job ticket that requires refactoring existing code to meet accessibility standards.

Given starter code for a fictional company's website, I needed to improve readability and accessibility by adding correct HTML semantics and consolidate CSS style code.
